SUMMARY -> Project of website <br>
<br>
This project showed me how much I learned and how I am ready for work in that occupation. <br>
Still I have a lot to learn but with every step I am more closer to my goal. <br>
<br>
My thoughts about project and how I changed the way to learn over the space last 6-7 months. <br>
Now I can sit and learn for 5 to even 7 hours without long breaks and I see a huge change. <br>
Thanks that consistency I see more spectacular progress. <br>
Now thanks that project I can do responsive website with really good looking design using Bootstrap, JavaScript, SCSS. <br>
In next month, when I finished couple of project from advanced JavaScript, I will start to learn React and then, I will take to learning Vue.
